# Release notes

KeyboardKit tries to honor semantic versioning:

* Only remove deprecated code in `major` versions.
* Only deprecate code in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Avoid breaking changes in `minor` and `patch` versions.
* Code can be marked as deprecated at any time.

Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions, patches and BETA features, if the alternative is to not be able to release new critical features or fixes.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` once again activates the space drag gesture on long press instead of on press. 



## 7.7

This version aims to reduce the amount of lost keystrokes by adding a release outside tolerance, to let a button trigger a release event even if the release is a bit outside of the button bounds. The lack of such a tolerance may have caused lost keystrokes before, since it's easy to slide with your finger while typing and ending up with your finger outside the button bounds.

Since the best tolerance amount is still unclear, the `keyboardButtonGestures` view extension now lets you specify a tolerance, which is a percentage of the button width.

This version also adds a vertical threshold when moving the input cursor with the space button, since dragging the finger too much up and down can result in unexpected movement. 

This version also tweaks the emoji keyboards to look better and closer to the native ones.

There are also new keyboard actions, new url opening utilities, and a bunch of theme adjustments.   

### ‚ú® New Features

* `KeyboardAction` has new `systemSettings` and `url` actions.
* `KeyboardAction` has a new `standardAction` property.

* `KeyboardEmojiKeyboard` `KeyboardEmojiCategoryKeyboard` are tweaked to look closer to the system keyboards.
* `KeyboardGestures` now handles a release outside as a release inside, if the release happens within a tolerance area.

### üëë Pro changes

* `KeyboardTheme` has new `author`, `collectionName` and `foregroundColor` properties.
* `KeyboardThemeLivePreview` now renders light mode only as default.
* `License` has new `localizedCalloutActionProviders`, `localizedInputSetProviders` and `localizedKeyboardLayoutProviders` properties.

## 7.6

This version updates the new dictation beta feature, adjusts a lot of emoji skin tones and fixes some bugs.

The version also adds tools that make it possible to start keyboard dictation from DocumentGroup-based apps.

### üö® Important information

After receiving reports that the new dictation features required all apps to add dictation permissions to their `Info.plist`, a lot of work has been put into separating speech recognition from dictation.

As a result, you must now provide a `SpeechRecognizer` when using the built-in dictation features. An already implemented recognizer can be copied from the `SpeechRecognizer` docs. 

Removing the speech recognizer parts from the library makes the feature a little harder to use, but removes the need for all apps to specify the permission keys they really don't need.

### ‚ú® New Features

* `DictationContext` has new initializers for specific usages.
* `DictationContext` has a new `silenceLimit` that can be used to define after how many seconds of silence dictation should finish.
* `DictationContext` has a new `isDictationStartedByKeyboard` that can be used when a deep link can't be used to start dictation.
* `KeyboardDictationConfiguration` has a new `matchesDeepLink` that simplifies checking if a specific deep link should start dictation.

### üí° Behavior changes

* More parts of the dictation implementations now update the `DictationContext` `lastError`.

### üëë Pro changes

* `DictationIndicator` has been renamed to `DictationBarVisualizer`.
* `DictationOverlay` has been renamed to `DictationScreen`.
* `DictationScreen` now supports adding a done button.
* `DictationScreen` supports a style instead of using many parameters.
* `SpeechRecognizer` is a new protocol that is used to separate speech recognition from dictation.
* `StandardDictationService` now requires a speech recognizer.
* `StandardKeyboardDictationService` now requires a speech recognizer.
* `View.keyboardDictation(...)` now requires a speech recognizer.
* `View.keyboardDictationOnAppear(...)` is a new view modifier that can be used in DocumentGroup-based apps.
* `View.keyboardDictationOnDeepLink(...)` is a new view modifier that can be used to start dictation without an overlay.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* A duplicate emoji has been removed.
* Incorrect Pro themes have been adjusted.
* Incorrect `Emoji` skin tone variants have been adjusted.
* Incorrect `Emoji` neutral skin tone variants have been adjusted.
* `GestureButton` no longer triggers timed events if it's removed before it's released. 

### üí• Breaking changes 

* `KeyboardDictationService` `stopDictationInKeyboard` has been renamed to `handleDictationResultInKeyboard`.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` `viewWillPerformDictation` has been renamed to `viewWillHandleDictationResult`.



## 7.5.2

This version adjusts how the next keyboard button behaves.

The next keyboard gestures is now moved from the system keyboard button content view to the gesture modifier, which means that it will always apply to views that are modified with gestures for that action.

This release also fixes a problem, where `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` marking one initializer as convenience caused problems when inheriting it.

### üí° Behavior changes

* `SystemKeyboardButtonContent` no longer applies a `NextKeyboardButton` for `.nextKeyboard`.
* `StandardKeyboardActionHandler` no longer marks the `inputViewController` initializer as convenience.
* `View+KeyboardGestures` now applies a `NextKeyboardButton` for `.nextKeyboard`.



## 7.5.1

This version adds more emoji versions.

### üëë Pro changes

* `EmojiVersion` now includes 13.1, 13.0, 12.1, 12.0 and 11.0.



## 7.5

This version improves the theme and dictation engines to make them easier to use.

This version also deprecates the feature toggle for the new autocomplete provider and makes it the standard engine. It also renames the external provider to remote to better reflect what it does.  

### üö® Important information

This version adds a mandatory `id` to `KeyboardTheme`, which will make it possible to implement features like marking a theme as a favorite, persist references instead of values etc. While it's not mandatory to specify an `id` when creating a theme, it *is* a mandatory property, which means that any previously encoded data will fail to decode.

If you have persisted `KeyboardTheme` values in your app, please reach out via `info@getkeyboardkit.com` and decode failure handling will be added to the library to handle any lacking IDs.

### ‚ú® New features

- `DictationContext` has a new `appDeepLink` property.

## 7.3

This version adds a first PREVIEW of dictation support. It's a very early version that is not yet tested, but your feedback is very important.

This version keeps the experimental flag for the recently introduced autocomplete provider, until the next minor version. Make sure to test it and provide feedback.

This version adds a bunch of new keyboard themes with new style variations. This means that you can easily tweak a theme-specific set of parameters for the various themes.

### üö® Important information

This version introduces breaking changes with reference to "Breaking changes can still occur in minor versions and patches...". In this case, the benefits are massive since it lets us make many more types `Codable` and `Equatable`, which unlocks a bunch of capabilities.

This requires that the types can't contain non-codable types, such as `Image` or `Font`, which requires breaking changes to the current setup. Types that have `Image` properties will instead use raw `Data`, while types that have `Font` properties will use a new `KeyboardFont` property. `KeyboardFont` can be created in the same way as `Font` but if you want to use it with a SwiftUI view modifier, you have to use `.font(font.font)`.

Just reach out if these breaking changes cause problems. 

### ‚ú® New features

* `Dictation` is a new namespace with PREVIEW types that defines how to perform keyboard dictation.
* `KeyboardBackgroundStyle` has a new convenience initializer.
* `KeyboardBackgroundType` has a new `.clear` and `.verticalGradient` type.

* The `isAutoCapitalizationEnabled` flag no longer affects automatic downshifting when typing.



## 7.2

This version focuses on making it easier to style keyboards.

This version adds a theme engine to KeyboardKit Pro. The new `KeyboardThemeAppearance` can be used with the new `KeyboardTheme` to style keyboards with themes, which is a lot easier than defining custom appearances.

This version comes with three themes - `.cottonCandy`, `.neonNights` and `.tron`. You can use them in your own keyboads, or tweak them to create your own visual styles. More themes are coming in future versions.

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `KeyboardTextField` and `KeyboardTextView` now correctly resigns as first responder when they lose focus.



## 7.1

This version fixes some bugs and makes it even easier to setup KeyboardKit.

KeyboardKit Pro also has a new experimental and much better autocomplete provider that you can toggle on with the `FeatureToggle`:

```swift
FeatureToggle.shared.toggleFeature(.newAutocompleteEngine, .on)
```

Once this has been verified to work better than the current provider, it will replace it and this feature toggle flag will be removed.

Furthermore, the locale context menu has been refactored to work and look a lot better on iOS 16 and macOS 12. This unfortunately required a few breaking api changes, that hopefully will not affect anyone.

### ‚ú® New features

* `KeyboardInputViewController` now calls `viewWillSetupKeyboard` in `viewWillAppear` instead of `viewDidLoad`.
* `KeyboardRootView` uses a view builder instead of a static view. 

### üêõ Bug fixes

* `iPadKeyboardLayoutProvider` had a line accidentally removed, which caused English layouts to render incorrect. This has been fixed.
* `KeyboardInputViewController` now creates the keyboard view later, which makes it respect the safe areas better in landscape.
* `LocaleContextMenu` now uses the `KeyboardContext` to localize and sort locales. 

### üí• Breaking changes 

* `SpaceLongPressBehavior` cases have been renamed to read better. This should hopefully affect few people.



## 7.0

KeyboardKit 7.0 involves a major rewrite that aims to bring more consistency in naming and structure and to streamline the library to make future development easier. It bumps the platform deployment targets to iOS 14, macOS 11, tvOS 14 and watchOS 7 and removes all previously deprecated code and todos.

### Migrating from KeyboardKit 6

Although KeyboardKit 7.0 aims to introduce as few breaking changes as possible, there are some surface level APIs that will change. Some such changes are the removal of many shared instances and how more dependencies have to be passed in as parameters. If you are using the now removed shared instances, simply inject the instance as initializer or function parameter instead. 

KeyboardKit 7.0 makes the `SystemKeyboard` easier to use, where it now adds an autocomplete toolbar by default to make sure that the callouts has enough space, and to reduce the risk of memory leaks that was previously easy to add by accident when you connected the toolbar to the keyboard input controller's autocomplete function. If your keyboard uses a custom autocomplete toolbar, you must pass in `autocompleteToolbar: none` in the system keyboard initializer.

If you have problems upgrading to `7.0`, first try upgrading to `6.9`. It has a lot of deprecations in place to provide guidance. You may still experience breaking changes after that, but they will be fewer.
